The proposed framework uses a bottom-up pipeline to 
gradually infer a high-level representation of the scratchs and stains from low-level features in an back cover of mobile phone image. Firstly by mean of wavelet transform, the surface texture properties such as scratch and stain are decomposed into so-called wavelet characteristics. Then multivariate statistical approach, i.e. Hotelling $T^{2}$ control chart is utilized to monitor the mean vector of a multivariate process, which can be used to judge the existence of scratch defects in the sample image. 

\section{Maximal variance of moving window}


\section{Wavelet transform decomposition}
The continuous wavelet transform was computed by changing the scale of the analysis window, shifting the window in time, multiplying by the signal, and integrating over all times. In the discrete case, filters of different cutoff frequencies are used to analyze the signal at different scales. The signal is passed through a series of high pass filters to analyze the high frequencies, and it is passed through a series of low pass filters to analyze the low frequencies.



Here is one example demonstrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:cnn} that adapted from~\cite{hijazi2015using}.
